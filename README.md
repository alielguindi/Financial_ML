# Advanced Factor Models in Finance: Beyond Fama-French

## Introduction

This project explores the significance of factor models in finance, which serve as a fundamental framework for understanding stock price variances by reducing the dimensionality of the covariance matrix. These models are crucial for creating optimal portfolios, estimating corporate finance discount rates, and defining risk factors in quantitative risk management.

## Motivation

Despite the popularity and effectiveness of the Fama-French 3 and 5-factor models, there is a continuous need for innovation in factor modeling to capture the evolving dynamics of financial markets. This project is driven by the potential of statistical methods to enhance or even surpass the traditional factor models by providing deeper insights into risk factors and market behaviors.

## Goals

The aim of this project is to leverage statistical models to identify and assess risk factors that can outperform the traditional Fama-French benchmarks. By comparing various statistical models, we seek to highlight their relative strengths and performance on a specific dataset, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated factor models in finance.
